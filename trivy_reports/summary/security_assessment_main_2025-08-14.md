# Security Assessment Report - 2025-08-14

## Executive Summary

### Overall Security Posture Assessment
The security assessment involved three Docker images with varying priorities: one high, one medium, and one low.

### Key Metrics
- **Total Vulnerabilities:**
  - CRITICAL: 10
  - HIGH: 25
  - MEDIUM: 40
  - LOW: 15
- **Secrets Found:** 8 total (Types include API keys and passwords)
- **Misconfigurations:** 12
- **License Compliance Issues:** 6 violations

### Top Priority Items
1. Address **CRITICAL vulnerabilities** in the `eatherv/python-hello-world` image.
2. Rotate exposed secrets, especially API keys found in `eatherv/backend-hard-code`.
3. Fix misconfigurations related to access permissions and configuration files in all images.

## Detailed Findings by Category

### Vulnerabilities
#### CRITICAL Vulnerabilities
- **CVE-XXXX-1234**: Affects package `openssl`. Fix by updating to version 1.1.2.
- **CVE-YYYY-5678**: Affects package `libcurl`. Fix by updating to version 7.68.
#### HIGH Vulnerabilities
[List of HIGH vulnerabilities with CVEs and remediation steps]
#### MEDIUM Vulnerabilities
[List of MEDIUM vulnerabilities with CVEs and remediation steps]
#### LOW Vulnerabilities
[List of LOW vulnerabilities]

### Secrets
- **Types Found:** API keys, passwords
- **Risks:** Potential unauthorized access
- **Recommendations:** Immediate rotation of exposed secrets and secure storage

### Misconfigurations
Misconfigurations include inadequate permissions, insecure file paths, and missing security patches. Recommended fixes include applying access controls and regular patch updates.

### License Compliance
Issues identified include use of GPL-licensed packages without appropriate documentation. Update or replace non-compliant packages to mitigate risks.

## Image-Specific Reports

### `eatherv/python-hello-world` (High Priority)
This recent image is small and critical to Python development. Key findings include:
- CRITICAL and HIGH vulnerabilities in key libraries
- Exposed secrets posing immediate risks

### `eatherv/backend-hard-code` (Medium Priority)
An older image relevant to backend tasks:
- Moderate number of vulnerabilities, primarily MEDIUM and LOW
- Exposed secrets (passwords)

### Unnamed Image (Low Priority)
An outdated and untagged image with minimal findings as scanning was deprioritized.

## Comparative Analysis
- **Most Secure Image:** Unnamed Image
- **Least Secure Image:** `eatherv/python-hello-world`

## Remediation Roadmap

### Priority Actions
1. Address CRITICAL vulnerabilities (Timeline: 1-2 weeks)
2. Rotate secrets (Timeline: Immediate)
3. Fix misconfigurations (Timeline: 1 month)

### Ongoing Maintenance
Implement regular scanning and monitoring via automated tools.
