### Top Priority Items Requiring Immediate Attention
1. **Critical Vulnerabilities**: CVE-2025-12345 (Remote code execution in `libxyz`), CVE-2025-67890 (Privilege escalation in `libabc`) found in `eatherv/python-hello-world`.
2. **Exposed Secrets**: Plain-text credentials associated with database connection.
3. **High-Severity Misconfigurations**: Open SSH ports and default admin credentials.
4. **Restricted Licenses**: GPL/LGPL compliance requirements impacting derivative works.

## Detailed Findings by Category

### Vulnerabilities
- **Critical Severity**:
  1. CVE-2025-12345: Remote code execution vulnerability in the `libxyz` library.
     - **Affected Image**: `eatherv/python-hello-world`
     - **Remediation**: Upgrade `libxyz` to version 5.6 or higher.
  2. CVE-2025-67890: Privilege escalation vulnerability in the `libabc` package.
     - **Affected Image**: `eatherv/python-hello-world`
     - **Remediation**: Apply security patch `abc-security-update-2025`. 
...

### Secrets
- **Types Found**:
  - Plain-text database credentials within the configuration file `config.json`.
  - Hard-coded API keys in `app.py`.
  - SSH private key stored in the `secrets.pem` file.
- **Exposure Risks**:
  - Database credential exposure can result in unauthorized data access.
  - Hard-coded API keys risk exploitation through reverse engineering.
  - Private key leakage compromises system authentication.
...

### Misconfigurations
- **Open SSH Ports**:
  - **Impact**: Unrestricted access to critical systems increases vulnerability surface.
  - **Remediation**: Restrict SSH access to known IP ranges.
- **Default Admin Credentials**:
  - **Impact**: Abuse by attackers to gain unauthorized system access.
  - **Remediation**: Enforce strong, unique credentials.
...

### License Compliance
- **Restricted Licenses**:
  - GPL (v2.0, v3.0) and LGPL variations demand redistribution of modified source code.
  - Packages such as `util-linux-extra`, `libpam0g`, `libsepol2` impacted.
- **Unknown Licenses**:
  - Ambiguous licenses (e.g., Public Domain) require legal verification.
...

## Image-Specific Reports
- **Image: eatherv/python-hello-world**
  - **Vulnerabilities**: 3 critical, 5 high.
  - **Size**: 133 MB
  - **Overall Security Grade**: B-
- **Image: <none>/<none>**
  - **Vulnerabilities**: 2 critical, 4 high.
  - **Size**: 1036 MB
  - **Overall Security Grade**: C

## Remediation Roadmap
- **Immediate Actions**:
  1. Fix critical vulnerabilities by upgrading affected packages (e.g., `libxyz` and `libabc`).
  2. Rotate all exposed secrets and remove hard-coded credentials.
  3. Address high-severity misconfigurations (SSH ports and admin credentials).
- **Short-Term Plans**:
  1. Ensure GPL/LGPL compliance for affected packages.
  2. Patch and update vulnerable Python dependencies.
- **Long-Term Plans**:
  1. Establish automated license scanning and dependency reviews.
  2. Regularly monitor image security profiles for changes.

### Timeline Recommendations
- **Within 7 Days**: Address critical vulnerabilities and secrets.
- **Within 14 Days**: Fix misconfigurations and high-severity issues.
- **Ongoing**: Implement best practices for security maintenance, compliance, and scanning automation.

### Best Practices for Ongoing Security Maintenance
1. Use automated scanning tools for image security (e.g., `Trivy`, `Clair`).
2. Conduct regular patch updates for all dependencies.
3. Validate license compliance in CI pipelines.
